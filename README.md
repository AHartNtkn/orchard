# Orchard 

## Description

Orchard is a graphical user interface for manipulating opetopic cells.  The ultimate
aim is to have a kind of graphical proof assitant for higher category theory.

## Building

Orchard is written in Scala and uses ScalaFX/JavaFX for graphics.  Hence it requires JDK 1.7
which comes with the JavaFX runtime libraries, which can be downloaded from Orable. To build, 
simple clone the repository, download the latest ScalaFX jar file and put it in the directory 
/orchard-javafx/lib and then build using Sbt.
